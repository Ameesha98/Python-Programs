Some basic python programs and mini projects

Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Python is named after a TV Show called ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’ and not after Python-the snake.

Python 3.0 was released in 2008. Although this version is supposed to be backward incompatibles, later on many of its important features have been backported to be compatible with version 2.7.

## Contents of this repository

This repository contains some basic python programs and some mini projects like area calculator, battleship game and number guessing game and it also contains solution of some questions listed below 

1. Problem: 

    * A lot of people write English in short form:  they write \doesn't\ to imply does not, \can't\ to imply cannot and so on.
    * Your task is to detect all such short forms in a sentence and to provide an expanded form appropriate for the sentence.
    * Your solution should be able to take a paragraph of any length as input.

2. Problem:  

    * You output should contain words that have the same three alphabets in sequence and the three common alphabets.  Your input should       be able to take a paragraph of any length.
    * We need to detect the number of occurrences of words which have three words same in sequence and three common alphabets has been         encountered. 
    * Example:-
     "Cat is in our Pet Shop catalog "
      Here we encountered word 'cat' in Cat and Catalog 
      So we have to print the word 
      Output:- cat
      Word cat occurred in the sentence further in the following words: 
      Cat and catalog
    * Your program should be capable of taking a paragraph as an input.

3. Problem: 

    * A newspaper requires all first letters of a headline to be capitalized, the first letter of every sentence to be capitalized,           after every 100 words a new paragraph should begin and not more than 4000 characters to be displayed in a column.  
    * All relevant aspects of the news item must appear within these specifications.
    * Your solution should be able to accept an input of a randomly typed headline and news report that may not have any capitalization       and/or words limit. 

4. Problem:

    * A writer has a habit of writing Mr., Ms. etc. after every name.  The publisher is tired of having to manually remove the same and       in accordance with the American culture would like to allow only first names.  
    * Your solution should enable the publisher to automatically use only first names in the article.  
    * Your solution should be able to accept a paragraph of any length as input.
